# Automated Review Roll ups
In this repository, I have uploaded all of my periodic note templates. To make this work in your Obsidian, you need to install the plug ins dataview, tasks, and templater.

The templates dates will automatically be updated whenever you insert them. There is navigation at the top of each note to make it easy to go to a bigger, smaller, or previous time period.

This is an incomplete write up and I'll be expanding my explanations of everything either here or at [masonroyal.com](https://www.masonroyal.com). If anything is unclear, please let me know and I'll expand on it asap!

## Review roll ups
The goal of this is to automate reviews as much as possible so it's pretty frictionless. Doing it this way makes it very easy to see and remember the progress you're making towards your goals. It's also a good way to hold yourself accountable.

### Weekly

### Monthly
All the information from the weekly notes will roll up into the monthly note like this.

This pattern then continues all the way up to the year. Weekly -> Monthly -> Quarterly -> Yearly

## Habits
Habit tracking with dataview is very easy as well. It makes it easy to keep track of what you are or aren't doing and pull that information wherever you want it.

### Daily
Simply add a ðŸŸ© (or emoji of your choosing) to mark something as done. It's also very easy to track other types of information as you can see below

## Weekly review and intention setting
At the top of the daily note there are two sections, weekly intentions and remember from last week.

Weekly intentions are pulled from the current week. I do this at the beginning of a week.

Remember from last week is pulled from the previous week's note. I do that review at the end of the previous week.

I do acknowledge that there is some redundancy here but for now it works.


I think the rest is pretty self explanatory but if there's any confusion, I'm more than happy to clarify anything!
